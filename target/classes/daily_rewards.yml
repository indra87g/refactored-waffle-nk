# --- Rewards ---
# The rewards are given based on the player's streak.
# The list is 0-indexed, so the first reward is for a streak of 1, the second for 2, and so on.
# If the streak is longer than the number of rewards, it will loop back to the beginning.
# For example, if there are 7 rewards, a streak of 8 will receive the first reward again.
# NOTE: This version of the plugin requires numerical Item IDs. A list can be found here: https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/
